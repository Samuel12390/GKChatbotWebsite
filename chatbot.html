      <h3><p>Meet Roodle!</p></h3>
      <p>Your favorite search engine's least favorite cousin</p>
      <p>Roodle is the most uncouth chat bot you will ever meet. He really doesn't like being asked questions, and will let you hear about it when you ask him something.</p>
      <p>This bot fancies himself a snarky search engine, even though he is only a static page connected to an API.</p>
      <p>Roodle is all talk and deosn't mean anything (it's just a program after all), so don't pay its insults any serious mind and get some chuckles listening to this wannabe know-it-alls best attempts at criticizing you.</p>
      <h2>How to Interact:</h2>
      <p>This section will describe Roodle's functionality</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>Ask Roodle a personal question!</li>
        <li>To use the search engine, start your question with a question mark (?)</li>
      </ul>
