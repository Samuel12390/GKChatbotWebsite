    <h3><p>Meet Roodle!</p></h3>
    <p>Your favorite search engine's least favorite cousin</p>
    <p>Roodle is the most uncouth chat bot you will ever meet. He really doesn't like being asked questions, and will let you hear about it when you ask him something.</p>
    <p>This bot fancies himself a snarky search engine, even though he is only a static page connected to an API.</p>
    <p>Roodle is all talk and deosn't mean anything (it's just a program after all), so don't pay its insults any serious mind and get some chuckles listening to this wannabe know-it-alls best attempts at criticizing you.</p>
